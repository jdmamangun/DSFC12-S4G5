**Lights, Camera, SEO Automation: Crafting YouTube Stardom in One Click!**

YouTube has evolved to be the largest video-sharing platform on the internet, boasting a staggering user base of over 2.70 billion individuals. While some perceive it as a simple app for passing the time, others recognize it as a potentially lucrative venture. Despite the ease of uploading videos, the real challenge lies in getting people to discover them. This challenge underscores the importance of search engine optimization (SEO) on YouTube. The platform's search algorithm prioritizes three elements in ranking search results: relevance, parsing of keywords in titles, tags, and descriptions; engagement, scrutinizing vanity metrics such as likes, comments, and subscribers; and quality, setting signals to assess expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness on a given topic. This study focuses on keyword optimization, a cornerstone of YouTube SEO.

The objective is to assist creators in publishing search-engine-optimized content by utilizing ChatGPT to compose a title, tags, and description that seamlessly integrates keywords identified in the titles of trending YouTube videos.

A systematic approach was taken, employing the following procedures: (1) to narrow down the scope, a specific category was chosen; (2) text preprocessing techniques, including tokenization, stop words removal, and lemmatization, were applied to the video titles to effectively extract keywords; (3) implemented Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a topic modeling technique, to cluster keywords into meaningful subcategories; (4) with a subcategory selected, determine the prevailing sentiment within descriptions to capture audience engagement; and (5) invoked ChatGPT via the OpenAI API to deliver a well-crafted title, tags, and description enriched with the identified keywords from the chosen subcategory. To ensure quality suggestions, a scoring system was established. This system requires that the generated content meet two critical conditions: the extracted keywords must be present in the title, tags, and description, and the overall sentiment of the description must align with the prevailing sentiment observed under the targeted subcategory.

In the exploration of YouTube content creation within the People & Blogs category, the study unveiled topics predominantly centered on pregnancy and gender reveals. This focus on family-oriented themes reflects the category's inclination towards personal narratives and experiences. As an illustrative example, ChatGPT was prompted to generate a cohesive title, tags, and description for content with a baby gender reveal theme. This demonstration emphasizes the potential of leveraging AI-driven tools to curate engaging and relevant content tailored to a niche within the broad landscape of YouTube.
